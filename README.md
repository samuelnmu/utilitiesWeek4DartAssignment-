This is week 4 Dart Assignment

You’ll create a powerful utility application in Dart! Here’s what you’ll do:

String Manipulation: Play with strings by concatenating, reversing, and changing cases. 🔤✨

Collections: Use lists, sets, and maps to organize and manage data. 📊

File Handling: Read from one file and write to another while managing errors. 📂✍️

Date and Time: Use Dart's DateTime class to format dates and calculate differences. ⏳🗓️

Finally, you’ll combine these elements into a small application that manipulates user input, stores results, and logs the date and time of entries.
